# Project Summary

In this project, we'll continue to use <a href="http://jxs.me/chinook-web/" target="_blank">Chinook</a> to create more intermediate SQL queries.

## Foreign Keys - New Table

### Summary

When creating tables we can specify a column as having a foreign key. The datatype of our column must match the datatype of the column we are linking to. The most common foriegn key is a primary key which is usually an integer.

### Instructions 

* Create a new table called `Movie` with an `ID`, `Title`, and `MediaTypeId`.
  * Make `MediaTypeId` a foreign key to the `MediaTypeId` column on the `MediaType` table.
* Add a new entry into the `Movie` table with a `Title` and `MediaTypeId`.
* Query the `Movie` table to get your entry.

### Solution
CREATE TABLE Movie (
  ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  Title TEXT,
  MediaTypeID INTEGER REFERENCES MediaType
);

INSERT INTO Movie
(Title, MediaTypeID)
VALUES
("Happy Cows", 2);

SELECT *
FROM Movie;

```sql
CREATE TABLE Movie (
  ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  Title TEXT,
  MediaTypeId INTEGER, 
  FOREIGN KEY(MediaTypeId) REFERENCES MediaType(MediaTypeId)
);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Add Movie </code> </summary>

```sql
INSERT INTO Movie ( Title, MediaTypeId ) VALUES ( "Aladdin", 3 );
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Foreign Keys - Existing Table

### Summary

We can also add a foreign key to an existing table. Let's add one to our `Movie` table that references `GenreId` on the `Genre` table.

### Instructions

* Add a new column called `GenreId` that references `GenreId` on the `Genre` table.
* Query the `Movie` table to see your entry.

### Solution
ALTER TABLE Movie
ADD COLUMN GenreID INTEGER REFERENCES Genre(GenreId);

SELECT *
FROM Movie;

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Add Foreign Key </code> </summary>

```sql
ALTER TABLE Movie ADD COLUMN GenreId INTEGER REFERENCES Genre(GenreId);
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Updating Rows

### Summary

We don't want to leave the `GenreId` equal to `null` so let's add a value using the update command. With an update command you always want to use a `WHERE` clause. If you don't you will overwrite data on all records.

### Instructions

* Update the first entry in the `Movie` table to a `GenreId` of `22`.
* Query the `Movie` table to see your entry.

### Solution
UPDATE Movie
SET GenreID = 22
WHERE Title = 'Happy Cows';

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Updating First Entry </code> </summary>

```sql
UPDATE Movie SET GenreId=22 WHERE id=1;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query Movie Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie;
```

</details>

</details>

## Using Joins

### Summary

Now that we know how to make foreign keys and change data, let's do some practice queries. The simplest way to use a foreign key is via a join statement. 

### Instructions

* Join the `Artist` and `Album` tables to list out the Artist name and Album name.

### Solution
SELECT Artist.Name, Album.Title
FROM Artist
JOIN Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId;

<details>

<summary> <code> Artist and Album Join </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT a.title, ar.Name 
FROM Album a 
JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId;
```

</details>

## Using nested queries/sub-selects

### Summary

The next way to use a primary key is with a nested query/sub-select statement. By using parenthesis we can do a select inside of a select. This is really effective when you have a foreign key link between two tables because now we can filter our main query by criteria on a referenced table.

### Instructions

* Use a sub-select statement to get all tracks from the `Track` table where the `GenreId` is either `Jazz` or `Blues`.

### Solution
SELECT *
FROM Track
Where GenreId IN (SELECT GenreId
FROM Genre
WHERE Name = 'Jazz' OR Name = 'Blues')

<details>

<summary> <code> Sub-Select </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Track 
WHERE GenreId IN ( SELECT GenreId FROM Genre WHERE Name = 'Jazz' OR Name = 'Blues' );
```

</details>

## Setting values to null

### Instructions

* Update `Phone` on the `Employee` table to `null` where the `EmployeeId` is `1`.
* Query the `Employee` table to get the employee you just updated.

### Solution
UPDATE Employee
SET Phone = null
WHERE EmployeeId = 1;

SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeId = 1;


<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> Setting to null </code> </summary>

```sql
UPDATE Employee SET Phone = null WHERE EmployeeId = 1;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Query the Employee Table </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId = 1;
```

</details>

</details>

## Querying a null value

### Summary

Sometimes you want to know when there is no value. For example, let's use the `Customer` table to figure out which customers do not have a company.

### Instructions

* Get all customers from the `Customer` table who do not have a company.

### Solution
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Company IS null;


<details>

<summary> <code> No Company Customers </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * from Customer WHERE Company IS null;
```

</details>

## Group by

### Summary

How many albums does each artist have? We could count manually, but no! Group by allows us to do aggregate counts.

### Instructions

* Select all artist ids, artist names, and count how many albums they have.

### Solution
SELECT Artist.artistId, Artist.name, count(*) number_of_albums
FROM Artist
JOIN Album ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId 
GROUP BY Artist.artistId;


<details>

<summary> <code> Group By </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT ar.artistId, ar.name, count(*) 
FROM Artist ar
JOIN Album a ON ar.ArtistId = a.ArtistId 
GROUP BY ar.artistId;
```

</details>

### Challenge

Modify the solution to order the album count by largest to smallest.

## Distinct

### Summary

Distinct is great if you want to get a dataset with no duplicates. 

### Instructions

* Get all countries from the `Customer` table with no duplicates.

### Solution



<details>

<summary> <code> No Duplicate Countries </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customer;
```

</details>

## Delete Rows

### Summary

Deleting rows can be dangerous if you are not cautious. Always do a select of what you plan to delete to make sure that you are going to delete the correct records.

### Instructions

* Select all records from the `Customer` table where fax is null;
* Delete all records from the `Customer` table where fax is null;

### Solution
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Fax IS null;



<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solutions </code> </summary>

<details>

<summary> <code> All null fax numbers </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Fax IS null;
```

</details>

<details>

<summary> <code> Delete null fax Customers </code> </summary>

```sql
/* The delete won't work since they are children using a foreign key. However, if there wasn't a foreign key, you would successfully delete all Customers WHERE Fax is null */
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE Fax IS null;
```

</details>

</details>
